# ⚠️ Caution: Rename Module and References

Before using this template, make sure to:

1. **Rename the Go module** in `go.mod` to your own module path.
2. **Replace all occurrences** of `micros-template` and related words throughout the project with your own naming.

This ensures your project is uniquely identified and avoids conflicts with the template source.
